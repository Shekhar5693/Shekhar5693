## Hi there, I'm Shekhar Bahuguna - aka Shekhar5693 ğŸ‘‹ 

### I'm a test automation engineer and a learner!!

- ğŸ”­ I just learned test automation using selenium and python.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning other new things.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m willing to collaborate with other test automators.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Other than coding, I like to play video games, and have recently started to dive deep into the rabbit hole of being an audiophile.
